This project is a landing page developed for the testing process at [Buzzvel](https://buzzvel.com).

For the development process I used the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) Framework.

## Getting Started

## Project details

The deployment of this project was carried out at Vercel and can be accessed on [Soller](https://buzzvel-dev-test.vercel.app/)

### Font load

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

### URL sharing

To share the URL on social media, I created art based on the proposed concept.

Just share the URL `https://buzzvel-dev-test.vercel.app` and the image will be loaded with other site informations.

### Favicon

Also using the concept provided, I created a Favicon based on the fictional logo.

### Mobile Menu

In the concept provided in Figma, a menu for mobile devices was not used, so with the intention of improving the user experience, I added a mobile menu.
